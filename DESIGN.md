# Fluxus Stream Processing Engine Design Document

## 1. Introduction

Fluxus is a lightweight stream processing engine written in Rust, designed for efficient real - time data processing and analysis. It provides high - performance stream processing capabilities with a type - safe API, making it easy to use and extend.

## 2. Features

### 2.1 High - Performance Stream Processing

Fluxus is optimized for real - time data processing, leveraging Rust's performance characteristics to handle high - volume data streams efficiently.

### 2.2 Flexible Windowing Operations

- **Tumbling Windows**: Fixed - size, non - overlapping windows.
- **Sliding Windows**: Fixed - size, overlapping windows.
- **Session Windows**: Variable - size windows based on inactivity gaps.

### 2.3 Parallel Processing Support

The engine supports parallel processing of data streams, allowing for better utilization of multi - core processors.

### 2.4 Rich Set of Stream Operations

Fluxus provides a variety of stream operations, including `map`, `filter`, and `aggregate`, enabling users to perform complex data transformations.

### 2.5 Type - Safe API

The API is type - safe, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors and providing better developer experience.

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 Core Components

- **`fluxus - api`**: Defines the core API and interfaces for the Fluxus engine. It serves as the contract between different components of the engine and user applications.
- **`fluxus - core`**: Contains the core implementations and data structures. This component is responsible for handling the internal logic of stream processing, such as windowing and operation execution.
- **`fluxus - runtime`**: Provides the runtime engine and execution environment. It manages the execution of stream processing tasks, including resource allocation and task scheduling.

### 3.2 Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**: Data streams are ingested into the engine.
2. **Stream Processing**: The data streams are processed using the defined operations and windowing strategies.
3. **Result Output**: The processed results are outputted to the specified destinations.

## 4. Design Principles

### 4.1 Performance - Oriented

The engine is designed with performance in mind. Rust's memory management and concurrency features are fully utilized to achieve high throughput and low latency.

### 4.2 Flexibility

Fluxus provides flexible windowing operations and a rich set of stream operations, allowing users to adapt the engine to different use cases.

### 4.3 Ease of Use

The type - safe API and well - structured project make it easy for developers to use and extend the engine.

## 5. Example Applications

```

### 5.6 Log Anomaly Detection

Detecting anomalies in log streams using sliding windows and aggregations.

```bash
cargo run --bin log-anomaly
```

### 5.7 Stock Analysis

Analyzing stock price data with tumbling windows and aggregations.

```bash
cargo run --bin stock-market
```


## 6. Development
